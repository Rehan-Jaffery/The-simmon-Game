Project Simon is a classic memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspired by the electronic game Simon, it challenges players to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds in the correct order.

The game interface is designed with HTML and CSS, featuring vibrant colors and intuitive layout for a visually appealing experience. JavaScript is utilized to implement the game's logic, including generating random sequences, handling user inputs, and tracking the player's progress.

Players start by observing a sequence of colors and corresponding sounds played by the game. They then must replicate the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the correct order. With each successful repetition, the sequence becomes longer and more challenging.

Project Simon offers a fun and addictive gameplay experience, testing players' memory and concentration skills. It provides immediate feedback on correct or incorrect sequences and keeps track of the player's high score for added competition.

Overall, Project Simon demonstrates the versatility of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating entertaining and interactive games that evoke nostalgia and provide hours of enjoyment for players of all ages.
